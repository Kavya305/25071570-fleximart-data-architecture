Summary
All input CSV files contained data quality issues such as duplicate records,
missing mandatory fields, inconsistent date formats, and non-numeric values.
These issues were handled during the Transform phase using appropriate
strategies such as record removal, data standardization, and default value
assignment. Only clean and valid records were loaded into the database,
ensuring data integrity and consistency across all tables.
